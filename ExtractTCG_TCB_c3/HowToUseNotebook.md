This notebook was utilised to create the products in the Geoscience Australia (GA) record, Groundwater dependent ecosystem assessment using remote sensing, eCat 148545.

The get_TCG_TCB_images_c3.ipynb notebook extracts the tasselled cap collection 3 products using a shapefile to define the extent.
The datasets extracted can then be utilised to create combined greenness/wetness datasets using the 10th percentile products. These combined datasets can 
assist in identifying areas of persistent greenness and/or wetness, indicating potential GDEs. Refer to the associated GA record for further details
on how these datasets were combined.

The notebook get_TCG_TCB_images_c3.ipynb is designed to run on DEA sandbox, https://app.sandbox.dea.ga.gov.au/. 
The DEA Sandbox is freely available. To sign up for an account, refer to https://docs.dea.ga.gov.au/setup/Sandbox/sandbox.html.
